# demo-golang

This is a simple Go project that demonstrates setting up a basic HTTP server with modular code structure.

## Project Structure

```
demo-golang/
├── main.go          # Entry point of the application
├── handlers/        # Contains HTTP handler functions
│   └── handler.go
├── models/          # Contains data models
│   └── model.go
├── utils/           # Contains utility functions
│   └── utils.go
└── go.mod           # Go module file
```

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the JSON response:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Welcome to the sample Go project!"
   }
   ```

## Features

- Basic HTTP server setup.
- Modular code structure for scalability.
- JSON response handling.

## Requirements

- Go 1.16 or later installed on your system.
